# PROG8165-17W-Assignments
Repository to handle the assignments of PROG8165-17W (Web Design and Development Principles)
Hi, Thomas Plathanath Mathew here. I am currently enrolled in the Mobile Solutions Development Course at Conestoga College, Doon, Kitchener. I use this repository to have collaborations on the development of assignments done in the course PROG8165 as part of the program Mobile Solutions Development.
Created New branch developments where index.html and main.css can be found. 
The page that Akshay has committed needs to be refined because there should be a get method to take you to the dash baord.
Uploaded initial dashbaord layout and the asspociated style file. Needs updation.
committed and pulled the final version of assignment 2
